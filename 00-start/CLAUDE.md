# Frontend Masters Fullstack Next.js Wiki - Barebones Starter

This is a **minimal, educational wiki app** built for Frontend Masters students. The app should be barebones, readable, and focus on core concepts rather than best practices or optimizations.

## Project Purpose

This is a **starter app** that Copilot builds, then **students will code along** during the course to transform it into a production-ready application. The instructor will guide students through upgrading each stub into real implementations.

**Important**: This code is designed to be **modified by humans** after Copilot finishes. The instructor and students will work together to replace stubs with real services during live coding sessions.

## Project Goals

- **Educational first**: Code should be simple and readable for students following along
- **Barebones MVP**: Bare minimum functionality, no bells and whistles
- **Easy to upgrade**: Each stub should be easily replaceable with real implementations during class
- **Working from day 1**: Students get a functional app to start with, then improve it together
- **Clear upgrade paths**: Students should see exactly what they'll be replacing and why

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Readable over optimal**: Choose simple, clear code over performant/best practice code
- **Minimal abstractions**: Avoid complex patterns, keep things straightforward
- **No premature optimization**: No caching, lazy loading, or performance tricks
- **Explicit over magic**: Prefer obvious code over clever shortcuts
- **TypeScript basics**: Use TypeScript but keep types simple and obvious

## Tech Stack (Barebones Version)

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (pre-configured, minimal custom CSS)
- **UI Components**: One page uses plain HTML/Tailwind, one page uses shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: In-memory JavaScript objects (not real database)
- **Auth**: Stub functions that return hardcoded users/roles
- **File Upload**: Saves to local /uploads folder, no processing
- **Email**: Stub functions that console.log instead of sending
- **AI**: Stub function that returns the input string
- **Tests**: Vitest and Playwright configured but empty
- **Deployment**: No deployment config (students will add this)

## File Structure Conventions

- **Database operations**: All in `/lib/models/` - makes it easy to swap implementations
- **Auth helpers**: All in `/lib/auth.js` - single file to replace with real auth
- **API routes**: Keep them thin, delegate to model functions
- **Stubs**: Clearly marked as stubs with comments

## Common Commands

- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run typecheck`: Run TypeScript checks
- `npm test`: Run Vitest unit tests
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run Playwright tests

## App Features (Minimal)

The wiki should have these basic features working:

- **Pages**: List all pages, view a page, create/edit pages
- **Users**: Hardcoded users with different roles (admin, editor, viewer)
- **Auth**: Fake login that switches between hardcoded users
- **Content**: Pages store title + markdown content
- **Files**: Basic file upload (save to disk, show in page)
- **Styling**: Most pages styled with Tailwind, one page uses shadcn components

## Database Schema (In-Memory)

```javascript
// users.js - hardcoded array
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Admin User", email: "admin@test.com", role: "admin" },
  { id: 2, name: "Editor User", email: "editor@test.com", role: "editor" },
  { id: 3, name: "Viewer User", email: "viewer@test.com", role: "viewer" },
];

// pages.js - array that gets modified
let pages = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Welcome",
    content: "# Welcome\nThis is our wiki!",
    authorId: 1,
    createdAt: "2024-01-01",
  },
];
```

## Stubs to Replace Later

These are intentionally minimal with obvious upgrade paths:

### Auth (Currently: Hardcoded → Will become: Stack Auth)

- **Current**: `/lib/auth.js` - returns hardcoded user objects, fake session management
- **Future**: Stack Auth React components, real sessions, middleware protection
- **Stub design**: Make auth functions async, return user objects with expected shape

### Database (Currently: In-memory → Will become: Neon + Drizzle)

- **Current**: `/lib/models/*.js` - manipulates JavaScript arrays in memory
- **Future**: Neon Postgres with Drizzle ORM, real schemas, migrations
- **Stub design**: All DB operations return Promises, use async/await everywhere

### Email (Currently: Console logs → Will become: Resend)

- **Current**: `/lib/email.js` - console.log instead of sending emails
- **Future**: Resend API for transactional emails (welcome, notifications)
- **Stub design**: Async functions that take email data objects, return success/failure

### AI (Currently: Echo → Will become: Vercel AI SDK)

- **Current**: `/lib/ai.js` - returns input string unchanged
- **Future**: OpenAI/Anthropic via Vercel AI SDK for content summarization
- **Stub design**: Async function that takes content string, returns "summary" string

### File Storage (Currently: Local disk → Will become: Vercel Blob)

- **Current**: Saves files to `/uploads` folder with basic file handling
- **Future**: Vercel Blob storage with URLs, metadata, proper file management
- **Stub design**: Upload functions return file objects with url, size, type properties

### Caching (Currently: None → Will become: Upstash Redis)

- **Current**: No caching at all, direct data access
- **Future**: Upstash Redis for page content, user sessions, expensive queries
- **Stub design**: Add cache keys/TTL parameters to functions, but don't actually cache

### Testing (Currently: Empty → Will become: Full test suite)

- **Current**: Vitest and Playwright installed but no tests written
- **Future**: Unit tests for models, E2E tests for auth flows, CRUD operations
- **Stub design**: Testable functions with clear inputs/outputs, no side effects

### Deployment (Currently: Local only → Will become: Vercel + GitHub Actions)

- **Current**: No deployment configuration
- **Future**: Vercel deployment, environment management, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **Stub design**: Environment variables clearly separated, build scripts ready

## Important Notes

- **No real security**: This is for learning, not production
- **No error boundaries**: Keep error handling minimal for clarity
- **No loading states**: Students will add these later
- **No form validation**: Beyond basic required fields
- **No responsive design**: Basic mobile-friendly but not comprehensive
- **Seed data**: Include a few sample wiki pages so app isn't empty

## What NOT to Include

- No complex state management (just useState)
- No advanced React patterns (memo, callbacks, etc)
- No performance optimizations
- No SEO considerations
- No accessibility beyond basics
- No internationalization
- No complex animations or transitions
- No search functionality (would be nice but scope is too big)

## Development Approach

- Build the simplest thing that works
- Use console.log for debugging (no fancy logging)
- Hardcode values when it makes the code clearer
- Prioritize readability over DRY principles
- Make it obvious where upgrades will happen later
